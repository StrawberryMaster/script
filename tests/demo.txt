# Comments should be ignored

# Blank lines are also ignored (like above)

Question 1: Do you like the hit game Among Us? # opening a line with "Question" indicates that a new question is beginning, and ends the previous question. you can write anything you want until the first ":", so technically both "Question amogus sus:" and just "Question:" are valid

- no # the "-" denotes the start of an answer, and any space after that is truncated
(fuck you) # what is inside the brackets denotes the feedback for the answer
- yes
(sus)
- maybe # this answer has no feedback

Question 2: Another question! # this terminates the previous question and starts the new one.

- some answer
(cool)
- another one
(also cool)
